.. documents what repositories BI-Beacon project consists of


How to contribute
=================

BI-Beacon is partially open source; see the repositories table on what is
and what is not open.


Code quality
------------

We use Sonar Cloud to analyse the source code for code smells, bugs, security
issues and so on. Any pull requests fixing any such issue is very welcome,
and a good easy way to start contributing to the repositories.


Documentation build pipeline
----------------------------

This documentation is generated by sphinx through a series of build steps.

They are visualized like this.

.. graphviz::

    digraph docs_build_pipeline {

        client_examples [ label="client-examples" ]
        build_artifacts [ label="build-artifacts" ]
        docs            [ label="docs"]

        client_examples -> docs
        docs -> build_artifacts
    }
