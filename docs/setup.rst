If you have any issues, please refer to troubleshooting_.

.. note:: To reset or reconfigure a BI-Beacon, reboot it whilst it cannot
          connect to the router. E.g by doing any of the following:

          1. Change SSID or password on the router
          2. Turn off the router temporarily
          3. Move the BI-Beacon far away from the router

          When you plug it in again, BI-Beacon will try to connect and
          fail. It will then go into setup mode again.


Setup BI-Beacon via USB
-----------------------

You can also setup a BI-Beacon using a USB data cable, however this requires
that you are on a Linux machine with a user in the `dialout` usergroup.

Clone the cli repo (see :ref:`ref_repositories`).

Then, in a terminal of your choice,

   $ python config_via_usb.py <ssid> <password> <systemid>
